## Project Overview

The **Sweet Shop Web Application** is a full-stack e-commerce platform developed to digitalize the traditional sweet shop business. The application allows users to browse sweet products online, view detailed product information, and interact with a modern, responsive interface.

The project demonstrates end-to-end web development using the **MERN stack**, focusing on scalability, clean architecture, secure authentication, and real-world deployment practices.

## Objectives of the Project

* To build a real-world full-stack web application using modern technologies
* To provide an intuitive UI for browsing and managing sweet products
* To implement secure backend APIs with authentication
* To deploy frontend and backend services on cloud platforms
* To follow industry-standard project structure and best practices

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

* **React.js (Vite)** – Component-based UI development
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**
* **HTML5 & CSS3**
* **Responsive Design** for desktop and mobile
* **Vercel** – Frontend deployment

### Backend

* **Node.js** – Server-side runtime
* **Express.js** – REST API framework
* **MongoDB Atlas** – Cloud NoSQL database
* **Mongoose** – ODM for MongoDB
* **JWT Authentication** – Secure user sessions

### Tools & Services

* **Git & GitHub** – Version control
* **Postman** – API testing

## Key Features

* User-friendly and responsive UI
* Sweet product listing with details
* Secure backend APIs
* MongoDB database integration
* Environment-based configuration
* Production-ready deployment
* Clean folder structure (Frontend & Backend separation)

## Project Architecture

The project follows a **client–server architecture**:

* **Frontend** handles UI, routing, and API interaction
* **Backend** handles authentication, business logic, and database operations
* **MongoDB Atlas** stores application data
* **Vercel** serves the frontend application

This separation ensures scalability, maintainability, and performance.
